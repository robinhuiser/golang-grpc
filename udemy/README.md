# gRPC [Golang] Master Class notes

My scribbles made during the Udemy's [gRPC [Golang] Master Class](https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-golang/).

I check-out the course material as sub-module via:

~~~bash
# Access the course material
$ git submodule add \
    https://github.com/simplesteph/grpc-go-course \
    course-material
~~~
