# gRPC Basics: Go

Notes from my understanding and working through [gRPC Basics: Go](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go/).

I am following the [gRPC Basics for Go](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go/) from the core project itself; it will guide me through:

* Define a service in a `.proto` file.
* Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
* Use the Go gRPC API to write a simple client and server for my service.

Next to this I am seeking clarity considering:

* Authentication
* Server / service discovery

As a proof I actually understand all of what has been absorbed... I intend to write a Golang **gRPC client** securely connecting to a Java **gRPC server** deployed within Docker (using docker-compose).
