# Golang primer gRPC

It is sunday afternoon during the Covid-19 lockdown... it is raining and the wife is studying for her university exams next week... so THE perfect time to do some research on a new subject (for me): gRPC & Golang.

I have worked through the following hands-on and theory to get a better understanding, see my notes:

1. The inevitable [quick start](./quickstart.md) guide
1. Diving into [theory](./grpc-theory.md) considering gRPC
1. A more [elaborated hands-on exercise](./go-basics-grpc.md) considering gRPC for Go
