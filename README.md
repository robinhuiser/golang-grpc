# Golang & gRPC

It is sunday afternoon during the Covid-19 lockdown... it is raining and the wife is studying for her university exams next week... so THE perfect time to do some research on a new subject (for me): Golang & gRPC.

I have worked through the following hands-on and theory to get a better understanding, see my notes:

1. The inevitable [quick start](./quickstart.md) guide
1. Diving into [theory](./grpc-theory.md) considering gRPC

I got excited an decided to purchase the Udemy courses: .

* [Complete Guide to Protocol Buffers 3 [Java, Golang, Python]](https://www.udemy.com/course/protocol-buffers/) -- checkout my [course notes](https://github.com/robinhuiser/protocol-buffers)
* [gRPC [Golang] Master Class](https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-golang/) -- see [my course notes](./udemy/README.md) under directory `./udemy`.

My goals are to learn more about:

* Authentication / security / encryption
* Server / service discovery
* Loadbalancing
